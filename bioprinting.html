									<blockquote><span class="highlights">This project was carried out as a part of the elective course, Presenting Information.</span> As an information professional, it is very important for us to understand different ways of presenting information because communicating with professional from different backgrounds, is a major part of our job responsibility. We need to present our ideas in a way that they are able to understand it and use it. The purpose of this project was to tell a story using an infographic and help people understand the need for this revolutionary technology called bio-printing. <span class="highlights">The timeline for this project was one week</span></blockquote>

										<p><span class="infographic left"><img src="images/info-bioprinting3.jpg" alt="" /></span><h3 style="color: #534a7c;">Background</h3>Today we are facing numerous challenges in transplant industry because the number of people on waiting list are increasing exponentially while the number of donors hasnâ€™t seen considerable increase over the past decade. Even after having an organ transplant, there are chances that the body might not accept it. </p>
										<p>But some early innovators have begun printing 3D organs such as cartilage, heart and even brains using body tissues. These organs can be successfully used for the purpose of the transplant and the chances of  the body rejecting that organ is almost nil, because the organ will be made our own tissues. So this revolutionary technology is out there and it is successfully addressing the problems that we are facing today, so why isn't it being widely used? The only reason is that it is very expensive. Today a traditional kidney transplant costs us $80,000, but the cost of bio-printing is kidney is $300,000.</p>
										<p>For wide acceptance and adoption of this technology, it should be easily available, accessible and most importantly affordable. Scientists are working continuously to achieve this goal and very soon it will change the way we treat diseases.</p>
										
										<p><h3 style="color: #534a7c;">Process</h3>Infographics are different from presentation slides or information dashboard because they tell us a story using visual elements that are very easy to understand. To explain the need for bio-printing, I started by relating it to the 3D printers that is already doing wonders in various fields. The data displayed under today's scenario explains various problems that can be resolved with this new technology. Finally, the forecast gives an idea of about the future of bio-printing in the form of a timeline. It was lists out the challenges and benefits that we are going to see in future.</p>
